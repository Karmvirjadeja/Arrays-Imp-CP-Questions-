Let's delve deeper into the concepts of GCD calculation and modulo check to understand why they are central to solving the problem of making all elements of an array equal through the given operations.

Understanding the Problem
The problem is to determine if you can make all elements of an array equal by repeatedly choosing two distinct indices 
𝑖
i and 
𝑗
j and performing the operation 
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
→
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
+
𝐴
[
𝑗
]
A[i]→A[i]+A[j].

Operation Insight
The operation allows you to increase 
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
A[i] by 
𝐴
[
𝑗
]
A[j]. Over time, this means you can effectively increase any element by any multiple of other elements.

Mathematical Insight
To decide if you can make all elements equal, you should consider the nature of transformations allowed by the operation:

Operations and Transformations: The operation 
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
→
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
+
𝐴
[
𝑗
]
A[i]→A[i]+A[j] means you can add any element to another. This implies that if you can transform all elements to be the same, they must be congruent modulo some number that relates to the structure of the array.

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):

Definition: The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. It essentially captures the largest common factor that can be used to describe their relative differences.
Relation to the Problem: If you can make all elements equal, then the differences between any two elements must be multiples of a common number. This common number is the GCD of the array. This is because you can always achieve transformations in steps of GCD.
Why Modulo Check Works
GCD as a Basis:

Property: If the GCD of the entire array is 
𝑔
g, then any element 
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
A[i] can be expressed as 
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
=
𝑘
⋅
𝑔
A[i]=k⋅g for some integer 
𝑘
k. This is because each element must be a multiple of 
𝑔
g.
Implication: If two elements have the same remainder when divided by 
𝑔
g, their difference is a multiple of 
𝑔
g. Thus, you can adjust one to become another using the allowed operations.
Modulo Check:

Objective: To determine if all elements can be made the same, we need to check if all elements can be adjusted to a common value using the operations. This means checking if all elements have the same remainder when divided by the GCD of the array.
Steps:
Compute the GCD of all elements in the array.
Verify if all elements leave the same remainder when divided by this GCD. If they do, then any differences between elements are multiples of the GCD, and hence you can adjust them to be equal.
Detailed Example
Consider an array 
𝐴
=
[
12
,
15
,
18
]
A=[12,15,18].

Compute GCD:

Compute 
GCD
(
12
,
15
)
=
3
GCD(12,15)=3.
Compute 
GCD
(
3
,
18
)
=
3
GCD(3,18)=3.
Thus, the GCD of the array is 3.
Modulo Check:

For 
12
m
o
d
 
 
3
=
0
12mod3=0
For 
15
m
o
d
 
 
3
=
0
15mod3=0
For 
18
m
o
d
 
 
3
=
0
18mod3=0
All remainders are the same.
Since all elements have the same remainder when divided by 3, you can make all elements equal by adjusting them in steps of 3.

Conclusion
The key idea is that the GCD of the array helps determine the fundamental unit by which you can transform the array elements. By ensuring that all elements are congruent modulo the GCD, you confirm that it's possible to adjust all elements to the same value
